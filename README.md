# fluxxor-protected-store
Small utility to help generate stores in Fluxxor with support for enhancements like private methods.

Very quick and dirty. No idea if it breaks under certain conditions, works for me so far. You probably shouldn't use this.

Dependencies
-------------
There are none. It seems like fluxxor should be a dependency, but this lib will work just fine with any other library that creates stores like fluxxor does.
